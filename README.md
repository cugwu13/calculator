# Calculator
The goal of this project is to create a simple-function calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

This calculator works similar to simple 4-function calculators. Users can enter numbers and perform operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the numbers. Users also have the ability to change the sign of the entered numbers by pressing the **+/-** button

## Display Screen
#
### Input Display
The number that the user is currently entering is displayed on the bottom row of the display screen.
## Expression Display
The mathematical expression that the user is currently evaluating is displayed on the top row of the display screen.

## Functionality
It is important to note that the calculator only evaluates **two** numbers at a time. For example, if the user enters the following mathematical expression:
```zsh
12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =
```
then calculator will evaluate the expression as follows:
```zsh
(12 + 7) - 5 * 3 =
(19 - 5) * 3 =
14 * 3 =
42
```
